## 🎯 About RepoMetric

RepoMetric is a centralized GitHub organization observability platform designed to provide engineering teams with a unified view of repository health, CI/CD pipeline performance, development activity, and operational risk. 

The platform aggregates critical signals such as:
- ✅ Build status and pipeline execution time
- 📈 Commit activity and development velocity
- 🔍 Issues and pull requests tracking
- ⚡ GitHub Actions usage and cost monitoring

RepoMetric helps teams improve reliability, visibility, and data-driven decision making by turning scattered GitHub data into actionable insights.
