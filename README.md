About RepoMetric
RepoMetric is a centralized GitHub organization observability platform designed to provide engineering teams with a unified view of repository health, CI/CD pipeline performance, development activity, and operational risk. The platform aggregates critical signals such as build status, pipeline execution time, commit activity, issues, pull requests, and GitHub Actions usage into a single dashboard, enabling teams to quickly identify failures, bottlenecks, inactive repositories, and cost drivers. RepoMetric helps teams improve reliability, visibility, and data-driven decision making by turning scattered GitHub data into actionable insights.
